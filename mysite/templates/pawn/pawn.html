                    The king (♔,♚) is the most important piece in the game of chess.
                    The object of the game is to threaten the opponent's king in such
                    a way that escape is not possible (checkmate). If a player's king
                    is threatened with capture, it is said to be in check, and the
                    player must remove the threat of capture on the next move.
                    If this cannot be done, the king is said to be in checkmate,
                    resulting in a loss for that player. Although the king is the
                    most important piece, it is usually the weakest piece in the game
                    until a later phase, the endgame. Players cannot make any move that
                    places their own king in check.

                    The queen (♕, ♛) is the most powerful piece in the game of chess,
                    able to move any number of squares vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
                    Each player starts the game with one queen, placed in the middle of the
                    first rank next to the king. Because the queen is the strongest piece,
                    a pawn is promoted to a queen in the vast majority of cases.

                <p id="p3">
                    The bishop (♗,♝) is a piece in the game of chess. Each player begins
                    the game with two bishops. One starts between the king's knight and
                    the king, the other between the queen's knight and the queen. The starting
                    squares are c1 and f1 for White's bishops, and c8 and f8 for Black's bishops.

                <p id="p4">
                    The knight (♘,♞) is a piece in the game of chess, representing a knight
                    (armored cavalry). It is normally represented by a horse's head and neck.
                    Each player starts with two knights, which begin on the row closest to the player,
                    between the rooks and bishops.
                </p>


                <p id="p5">
                    The rook (/rʊk/; ♖,♜) is a piece in the game of chess. Formerly the piece
                    (from Persian رخ rokh/rukh) was called the tower, marquess, rector, and
                    comes (Sunnucks 1970). The term castle is considered informal, incorrect,
                    or old-fashioned.[1][2]
                </p>


                <p id="p6">The pawn (♙,♟) is the most numerous piece in the game of chess,
                    and in most circumstances, also the weakest.
                    It historically represents infantry, or more particularly,
                    armed peasants or pikemen. Each player begins a game with eight pawns,
                    one on each square of the rank immediately in front of the other pieces.
                    (The white pawns start on a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2;
                    the black pawns start on a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7.)
